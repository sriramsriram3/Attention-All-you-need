# Attention Is All You Need: Implementation and Insights

Attention all you need research paper simple description

This project is an implementation of the Transformer model, as introduced in the groundbreaking paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. The Transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by introducing a fully attention-based mechanism for sequence-to-sequence tasks, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional layers.

## Key Features
Self-Attention Mechanism: Enables the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence, capturing long-range dependencies effectively.

## Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Composed of:
Encoder: Processes the input sequence using self-attention and feed-forward layers.
Decoder: Generates the output sequence with masked self-attention and cross-attention layers.
Positional Encoding: Adds position information to the input embeddings, enabling the model to consider sequence order.
Scalability: Highly parallelizable and efficient for large datasets and long sequences.

## Workflow
Input Representation:

Inputs are tokenized and converted into embeddings.
Positional encodings are added to embeddings for sequence order information.
### Encoder:

Applies multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers to create contextualized embeddings of the input.
### Decoder:

Uses masked self-attention to focus on previously generated tokens.
Combines cross-attention with encoder outputs to generate predictions.
### Output Generation:

Final predictions are decoded into text using a vocabulary lookup.
